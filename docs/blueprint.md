- Color Palette: Allow users to select colors from a palette or enter hex codes directly.
- Layer Management: Enable users to add, delete, reorder, and adjust the opacity of layers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#3F51B5) to create a sense of depth and creativity.
- Background color: Dark gray (#212121) to emulate a noir-style canvas.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BE03FC) for highlights and interactive elements, drawing attention to key areas.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for headlines and short body text. This font evokes computerized design, fitting well in the app.
- Use simple, modern icons in white or the accent color to ensure they stand out against the dark background.
- A minimalist layout with a focus on the canvas area, placing tools in unobtrusive panels that can be easily accessed.
- Subtle animations for tool selection and layer transitions to provide a polished feel.
